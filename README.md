# Yahtzee Game

A simple single-player Yahtzee game coded in Ruby born out of love for my sister and the game. üòÑ
My sister and I are die-hard Yahtzee fans playing it when waiting for our food at the restaurant or while having cocktails at a bar. But since she lives far away I decided to channel my boredom into something productive: coding. This game is a heartfelt tribute to our epic dice battles and a way to practice my Ruby skills.
While it's technically a solo experience the spirit of sibling rivalry lives on one roll at a time.

## Features

- Roll 5 dice and calculate your score
- Enjoy a quick round of Yahtzee without needing another player

A classic dice game where the players roll five dice and tries to achieve specific combinations, like a full house, large straight or Yahtzee (five-of-a-kind) to score points.
The player has a scorecard with various categories and every round they roll the dice up to three times to get the best possible combination.
The goal is to score the highest total points by the end of the game, with strategic decisions on which categories to fill and when to take risks.
